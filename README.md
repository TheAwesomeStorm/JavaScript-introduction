# Introduction to JavaScript

This project was created to reiforce the learnings I got with the Alura course named **JavaScript: Programando na l√≠nguagem da web**

The HTML and CSS was given at the start of the course and the JavaScript was coded from scratch

You can view the course project at [Tabela de Acompanhamento](https://theawesomestorm.github.io/Introduction-to-JavaScript/)
